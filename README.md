# INC.
quite the name, isn't it? INC. all caps, one period. 

might stand for incorporated. could be an artistic spelling of the word "ink". maybe it's nothing at all.

INC. a magazine created by some idiot with a little too much time on his hands.

## ISSUE 1: PILOT

## LICENSE ðŸ„¯
this is the same block i put in the back of every copy of INC. steal it! use it for your own projects! make it better then i can!

this work, in its entirety, is licensed to you under the GNU GPL v3, the full text of which is available at https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt. that's right baby. this shit copyleft, all rights reversed. if you follow that link, you'll find a whole bunch of legal jargon which is really boring. here's my summary of it:

- you are guaranteed four freedoms: the right to use the work, the right to study the work, the right to share the work, and the right to modify the work and to distribute those modified copies..
- this is a copyleft license, meaning that you must release your modified copies under the GPL as well
- you are not required to pay me for it! this is free and open source right here. it would be very nice however.
	- this does not mean that you can't make a modified copy and distribute it at cost. the GPL explicitly allows this.
- read the wikipedia article on it, they explain it better then i do.

i'm not a lawyer. this summary is "pretty good" if you ask me, but i might be wrong on some parts. read the *actual* GPL. it's good for your health!
